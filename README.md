###  Wage-Prediction of US Permanent Visa Applicants.
#### Intro
Permanent Visas are issued by Department of Homeland Security's US Citizenship and Immigration Services for immigration of labour where shortage of skills and lack of ability is experienced.Department of labour allows employers to hire foreign workers(Alien) to work permanently in US under the understanding that american workers will not face adverse effect in wages & working conditions. Our aim is to predict wages of the visa applicant considering their education,country of origin,current wage in the industry etc.We frame this problem as Regression as our first approach & Classification problem as our second approach.We have applied multiple algorithms and have compared their results using multiple evaluation metrics in the end. As salary in a way is a direct indicator of in-demand industrties to make career in, such models may help US lawmakers to understand and design policies so that new generations could get better & relevant skills which are currently imported from outside.Also this models could be employed by employers to understand long term cost accrual of human resource for the field they are in.
